#Javascript

### What is javascript?
- is a multiparadigm language
	- has functional, object oriented capabilities
	- prototyping language (dont use classes like in java)
	- loosely-typed language - can switch data types of variables

### Data Types
- different types
	- number
	- string
	- boolean
	- null
	- undefined
	- objects
- literal - is a value
- identifier - names that you define in the code
	- variable names
	- objects names
	- function/method names
- numbers are stored as floats in javascript
	- largest and smallest number in javascript
	- (longest string in javascript)
- null and undefined are recognized value in javascript
- data type conversions
- typeof - to get type of variable

### Operators
- types of operators based on number of operands
	- unary
	- binary
	- ternary
- expression - built with operands and operators
	- arithmetic
	- logical
		- bitwise logical operators
	- comparison
	- string (concatenation)
- precedence

### Comparison Operator
- == - compares values but ignores types
- === - identity operator - compares values and types of operands

### Bitwise Operators
- treat operands as a sequence of 32 bits rather than decimal, hexadecimal, or octal

### Variable
- reference to space in memory that holds data
- declared using let/var
- "every variable is a property"
- scope of variable
	- var - global variable
	- let - local variable
- new - creates a new object
	- can use wrapper classes to gain object functions for primitive values
- primitive data types
- reference data types
