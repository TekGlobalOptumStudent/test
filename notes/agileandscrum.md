# Agile & SCRUM
## Agile & Scrum
### Traditional App Dev Methodology
* Requirements Analysis - document all aspects of the business, system, and user requirements at the initial step in the project
* Design - based on the completed set of requirements, design the system(s), databases, integrations and user interfaces
* Development - create the code for the application
* Testing - create test cases based on the the requirements of code developed
* Implementation - (go live phase) release to public
* Maintenance - post deployment stage of bug fixes, enhancements, upgrades

### Problems
* assumes all requirements are known up front and nothing will change
* can take several months or even years from start to finish
* if requirements chance, schedule can be significantly impacted
* if testing uncovers design or requirement errors, may also be crippling

### Requirement Analysis
* Most important part of SDLC
* What we want, what we have, what is gravy
* Functional requirements - define what the software must do
* Non-functional requirements - define 
system performance and security availability
* Requirement Specifications -
* Requirement Defects - 
* Management of Requirements - 
* Requirement Analysis Tools - 

### Knowledge

### SDLC Software Development Life Cycle
* waterfall methodology - inferior version that attempted to complete a project in one go
* SCRUM Members
	* Scrum Master - coach, tasked with removing roadblocks and facilitates meetings
	* Product Owner - owns the product backlog, represents the business, grooms user stories by prioritizing and writing acceptance criteria
	* Ad Hoc Members - specializers that may be brought in short term for a sprint
	* Stakeholders - anyone else that has interest, can join sprint reviews
* SCRUM Artifacts
	* Product Backlog - lists of epics and user stories
	* Sprint Backlog - list of user stories to be added in the sprint
	* Increment - body of work accepted by the product owner at end of sprint
* SCRUM Backup Items
	* Epic - big chunk of work that has one common objective
	* User story - captures a description of a feature from an end-user perspective
	* Task - smaller work items used to break a story into smaller units 

### STLC Software Testing Life Cycle
* Requirement Anaylsis
* Test Planning
* Test Case Development
* Environment Setup
* Test Execution
* Test Cycle Closure
